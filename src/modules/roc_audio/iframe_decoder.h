    //! Get decoded stream position.
    //!
    //! @returns
    //!  the position of the next sample that will be retrieved by read().
    //!
    //! @remarks
    //!  The decoded stream position is affected by begin(), read(), and shift() methods.
    //!  begin() changes it according to the provided frame position, however it depends
    //!  on the implementation how exactly. read() and shift() increase it by the number
    //!  of samples they returned.
    virtual packet::timestamp_t position() const = 0;

    //! Get number of samples available for decoding.
    //!
    //! @returns
    //!  number of available samples per channel, or zero if there are no more
    //!  samples in the current frame, or if begin() was not called yet.
    //!
    //! @remarks
    //!  The number of samples available is affected by begin(), read(), and shift(),
    //!  and end() methods. begin() resets it according to the provided frame size,
    //!  however it depends on the implementation how exactly. end() resets it to zero.
    //!  read() and shift() decrease it by the number of samples they returned.
    virtual packet::timestamp_t available() const = 0;

    //! Start decoding a new frame.
    //!
    //! @remarks
    //!  After this call, read() will retrieve samples from given @p frame_data, until
    //!  @p frame_size bytes are read or end() is called.
    //!
    //! @note
    //!  @p frame_position defines the position of the frame in the encoded stream.
    //!  Decoder updates the decoded stream possition according to @p frame_position,
    //!  but not necessary to the same value. Encoded and decoded stream positions
    //!  may be slightly different, depending on the codec implementation.

    //! Read samples from current frame.
    //!
    //! @b Parameters
    //!  - @p samples - buffer to write decoded samples to
    //!  - @p n_samples - number of samples to be decoded per channel
    //!  - @p channels - channel mask of the samples to be decoded
    //!
    //! @remarks
    //!  Decodes samples from the current frame and writes them to the provided buffer.
    //!
    //! @returns
    //!  number of samples decoded per channel. The returned value can be fewer than
    //!  @p n_samples if there are no more samples in the current frame.
    //!
    //! @pre
    //!  This method may be called only between begin() and end() calls.
    //!
    //! @note
    //!  Encoded and decoded channel masks may differ. If the decoded frame has
    //!  extra channels, they are ignored. If it doesn't have some channels, these
    //!  channels are filled with zeros.

    //!
    //! @b Parameters
    //!  - @p n_samples - number of samples to shift per channel
    //!
    //! @remarks
    //!  Shifts the given number of samples from the left, as if read() was called
    //!  and the result was dropped.
    //!
    //! @returns
    //!  number of samples shifted per channel. The returned value can be fewer than
    //!  @p n_samples if there are no more samples in the current frame.
    //!
    //! @pre
    //!  This method may be called only between begin() and end() calls.

    //! Finish decoding current frame.
    //!
    //! @remarks

    //!  should be started by calling begin().
